		rText[1] = "Composure is important, peace...I have my coat, my “pledge”, my noose for the ax, why did I decide on ax….ax? I haven’t got it, agh Nastasia is in the kitchen! Why? It’ll be downstairs. Ah...stupid miscalculation, foolish blunder, must get on….";
		rText[2] = "Why have I got this hat on? I should’ve left it, gotten a new one, agh...is this right? Will I? Have I the strength? Must hurry, its already rung seven. The louse’s home is down this way, cross two bridges.";
		rText[3] = "This suffocating, dusty, urban sprawl of St. Petersuburg is asphyxiating my individuality...";
		rText[4] = "It has occured to me that these houses appear similiar. It is as if they were duplicated over and over again.";

		rText[6] = "What if… What If man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the whole race of mankind - then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be? No barriers…..no control, what if I do not exist on the physical plane? What am I, perhaps mere electrical signals, a conglomeration of information on a black mirror, controlled by beings beyond this dimension...What If I’m in a video game?!";
		rText [7] = "I love to angst the angst to angst to put angst in angst.";
		rText[8] = "It could be said that libertarianism holds that the raison d’etre of the observer is social comment, but only if the premise of semanticist theory is valid; otherwise, Lyotard’s model of libertarianism is one of “Foucaultist power relations”, and hence a legal fiction. Lyotard suggests the use of cultural postcapitalist theory to challenge the status quo.";
		rText[9] = "My favorite color is abyss.";
		rText[10] = "I can seize it...the power is there for my taking. Am I pale? Will it give it away? Alyona is distrustful, she’ll know...she’ll know!";
		rText[11] = "Good evening, I’ve brought you…a pledge, Iam Raskolnikov, formerly a student, you remember me...please let me in...I have something...to give you.";
		rText[12] = "Please, you know me, I am in a hurry, please take a look, a silver cigarette case…";
		rText[13] = "It is times like these that I look to my favorite greek myth, about Νάρκισσος, or Narkissos...or Narcissus.";
		rText [14] = "Why does that man have the same jacket as me? Why is he the only man in the entire city? Why are the dogs immobile?";
		rText [15] = "Am I obvious? Do they see the ax...I've hidden it in the noose, right?";

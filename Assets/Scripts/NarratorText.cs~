No barriers…..no control, what if I do not exist on the physical plane? What am I, perhaps mere electrical signals, a conglomeration of information on a black mirror, controlled by beings beyond this dimension...What If I’m in a video game?!";

Lyotard suggests the use of cultural postcapitalist theory to challenge the status quo.";
